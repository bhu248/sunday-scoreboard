# Sunday Scoreboard — project notes for Claude Code

This file exists to hand off context from an earlier Claude session (Cowork)
to Claude Code. Read this before making changes — several bugs have already
been found and fixed here, and it's easy to accidentally re-introduce one of
them if you reason about the scoring model from scratch.

## What this is

A zero-secrets GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages system. Every few minutes during
NFL game windows, `scripts/poll.py` hits Sleeper's public, unauthenticated API
for league `1393377829990727680`, appends one timestamped snapshot to
`data/week<N>.jsonl`, and `scripts/render.py` rebuilds `docs/week<N>.html` — a
live dual-bar (actual + live-projected) time-lapse race chart — from the full
snapshot history. GitHub Pages serves `docs/`. No API keys, no secrets, no
auth anywhere in this project — keep it that way.

## File layout

- `scripts/common.py` — all Sleeper API calls, plus `team_game_progress()`
  (the one non-Sleeper external call, to ESPN's public scoreboard — see
  below), `score_stats()` (generic dot-product scorer using the league's own
  `scoring_settings`), and the players cache (`load_players_cache()` for
  display labels, `load_player_teams()` for each player's current team).
- `scripts/poll.py` — one poll → one snapshot. `compute_projected_total()` is
  the scoring model; read its docstring in full before touching it.
- `scripts/render.py` — rebuilds the HTML chart from the full `.jsonl`
  history: time-lapse bars, the 5 biggest plays, the week-winning-play
  marker, chronological slate labels ("Thursday Night Football" etc.),
  click-to-jump on markers/legend.
- `scripts/seed_dummy_data.py` — generates fake week-0 demo data with fake
  player-id labels like `"WR1 — deep TD catch"`. Dummy-data-only; if you ever
  see a garbled name like that in real output, it means dummy data leaked in,
  not a labeling bug.
- `.github/workflows/scoreboard.yml` — now `workflow_dispatch`-only. It used
  to also have a `schedule:` cron trigger; that was removed 2026-09-10 (see
  "Scheduling moved off GitHub, onto the local machine" below) because
  GitHub's scheduler was unreliable in production. The old cron windows are
  kept as comments in the YAML for reference only — they are not live.
- `scripts/local_scheduler.py` — the actual timer now. Runs every 5 minutes
  via a Windows Task Scheduler job (`SundayScoreboardLocalTrigger`) on
  bhu24's machine, checks `WEEKLY_WINDOWS`/`DATE_WINDOWS` (the local
  equivalent of the old cron list) against current UTC time, and calls
  `gh workflow run scoreboard.yml --repo bhu248/sunday-scoreboard` when
  inside a window. No-op outside game windows. Logs every decision
  (dispatched or skipped) to `local_scheduler.log` in the repo root
  (gitignored). The 2026-specific Friday/Saturday `DATE_WINDOWS` have no
  year field, so — same caveat as the old cron — review/remove that block
  before the 2027 season.
- `selftest.py` (repo root) — **not committed to the repo**, dev-only. Mocks
  every Sleeper call and runs `poll.py` + `render.py` against fake data,
  asserting exact expected numbers. Run this before shipping any change to
  `compute_projected_total` or the render logic. It has caught every
  regression described below.

## The scoring model — read this before touching `compute_projected_total`

Three different bugs have been found and fixed here, each one a plausible-
looking mistake:

1. **The kickoff-cliff bug (original).** A player contributed their full
   pre-game projection only while their actual points were exactly `0.0`;
   the instant they recorded ANY stat, their contribution dropped to just
   their actual, zeroing the rest of their projection. This made every
   team's "projected" total crater toward "actual" right at kickoff —
   backwards, since a player who just scored is usually still early in their
   game.

2. **The uniform wall-clock-decay bug.** While investigating a later issue,
   a retroactive "fix" decayed every roster's projection using a single
   assumed kickoff-time + fixed game-duration, applied to ALL rosters
   uniformly — including rosters whose players had recorded zero actual
   points. Result: scoreless teams' projections cratered too, just because
   time had passed, with no in-game justification. **Fix:** decay must be
   gated on `actual > 0` — see the gate in `compute_projected_total` (the
   `if pts > 0.0: ... else: elapsed = 0.0` block). A player who hasn't
   scored yet keeps their full, undecayed projection no matter how much
   wall-clock time passes; "hasn't scored" isn't evidence their opportunity
   is used up, it's just as likely their game hasn't gotten to them yet.

3. **The two-formulas-in-one-timeline bug.** The retroactive backfill from
   bug #2 used a fabricated wall-clock timer; live polls use a DIFFERENT
   formula based on `common.team_game_progress()` (ESPN's real scoreboard
   clock). These disagreed more and more as time passed, so the chart showed
   values sliding down through the middle of a game and then snapping back
   up near pregame levels the moment a fresh live poll landed — a visible
   "dip in the middle of the time-lapse." **Fix:** there must be exactly ONE
   formula for "projected," ever: `max(actual, pregame_projection)` per
   player when `team_game_progress` returns no real clock data (elapsed=0),
   decaying smoothly toward actual as elapsed approaches 1.0 when it does.
   Never retroactively rewrite history with a different formula than the one
   live polls are currently using — reconstruct historical "projected"
   values using the SAME formula live polls use, with real per-player
   pre-game projections (fetch each one individually from
   `https://api.sleeper.app/projections/nfl/player/<id>?season=...&week=...`
   — the bulk `/v1/projections/nfl/...` endpoint is too large for reliable
   single-key lookups by an LLM; the per-player endpoint is small and exact).

## ESPN dependency — currently dormant, not broken

`common.team_game_progress()` reads ESPN's public, unauthenticated scoreboard
(`site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/scoreboard`) to get each
game's live quarter/clock, because **Sleeper's own projections endpoint is
confirmed static** — it returns one unchanging pre-game number for the whole
week, verified by both the lack of any live-projection endpoint in Sleeper's
docs and by this project's own production data (a roster with zero scoring
players held an exactly unchanged projected total for over an hour of live
play). ESPN's clock is how "live" decay actually happens.

As of this hand-off, ESPN has **never once** reported the league's real Week
1 game (NE @ SEA, 2026-09-09) as anything but `STATUS_SCHEDULED`, checked
repeatedly over several hours including well after its actual kickoff time.
This means `team_game_progress()` has been returning empty/zero progress for
this entire game, so the decay feature has been sitting dormant — every
player's projection just holds at `max(actual, pregame_projection)` with no
time-decay, which is correct, safe, degraded behavior, not a bug. Don't
"fix" this without first re-checking ESPN's live status — the code is
working as designed for a game ESPN hasn't started reporting on.

**Update 2026-09-10: this is no longer purely dormant.**
`common.estimate_scoring_fallback_progress()` now fills the gap for exactly
this scenario: when a team's players are already posting real Sleeper stats
but ESPN still has that team at elapsed=0 (missing or `STATUS_SCHEDULED`),
it estimates elapsed from `(now - that team's first observed nonzero-score
snapshot) / FALLBACK_GAME_DURATION_SEC` (a fixed 3.5h stand-in for a game's
length), reading the fallback timestamp from this week's own
`data/week<N>.jsonl` history. ESPN's real clock is still trusted the moment
it actually reports one (frac > 0) for a team — the fallback only fires for
teams ESPN is silently treating as not-yet-started. `poll.py` blends this in
right after calling `team_game_progress()`, before `compute_projected_total`
ever sees it, so the existing `pts > 0.0` gate (see bug #2 above) still
applies exactly the same way regardless of which source produced `elapsed`.
Known tradeoff: because the fallback is a fixed-duration guess rather than a
real clock, there can be a one-time jump in a team's projected total at the
moment ESPN's status finally catches up and takes back over. See
`test_scoring_fallback()` in `selftest.py` for the regression coverage.

## Other known behaviors (not bugs)

- **Sleeper's pregame projections can drift slightly over time**, even
  before a player takes the field — a player's own projection number was
  observed shifting by a couple of points between polls taken hours apart,
  presumably from upstream injury/inactive-list updates. This is legitimate
  and expected; don't assume a small shift on a scoreless player's number is
  a sign of a decay bug resurfacing — check whether it's actually the
  player's source projection that moved.
- **Scheduling moved off GitHub, onto the local machine (2026-09-10).**
  Scheduled (`schedule:`) GitHub Actions triggers were never confirmed to
  fire reliably — manual `workflow_dispatch` runs always worked, but
  scheduled runs went missing for 15-20+ minutes or more at a time during
  the Week 1 opener (confirmed again right at the start of the Thursday
  Night Football window: no scheduled run fired for 19+ hours across a gap
  that should have had none, since the previous window had already closed
  cleanly), with nothing diagnosable from outside GitHub (workflow wasn't
  disabled, default branch was correct, no GitHub status incident, YAML/cron
  was valid). Root cause was never found and, per bhu24, isn't worth chasing
  further — instead, the `schedule:` trigger was removed entirely and
  replaced with `scripts/local_scheduler.py`, driven by a Windows Task
  Scheduler job on bhu24's own machine, which calls `gh workflow run`
  (`workflow_dispatch`) directly every 5 minutes during game windows. This
  has an obvious tradeoff worth surfacing if it comes up: the workflow now
  only fires while that machine is on, awake, and logged in — it's no
  longer a GitHub-side schedule. If snapshots are missing during a game,
  check the scheduled task's state/log first (see README "How it runs")
  before assuming it's a Sleeper/ESPN data issue.
- **`docs/week<N>.html` only reflects what's in `data/week<N>.jsonl` as of
  the last render.** After any direct edit to the `.jsonl` history, you must
  run `python scripts/render.py` (or trigger the workflow) to regenerate the
  HTML — the committed data and the committed page can drift out of sync
  otherwise.
- **Multiple fantasy rosters can share the same real NFL game.** Don't
  assume different roster IDs means different real games — in this league's
  Week 1 data, six different fantasy rosters all had a player in the same
  single NE@SEA game.

## Workflow for any change to the scoring/render logic

1. Make the change.
2. Run `python3 selftest.py` from the repo root — it must print
   `ALL SELFTESTS PASSED`. Extend its fake-data scenarios to cover whatever
   you just changed before considering it verified (see the scoreless-roster
   test case already in there as a template).
3. Only then commit/push.
