"""Local replacement for GitHub Actions' `schedule:` trigger.

GitHub's own cron scheduler was observed missing scheduled runs by 15-20+
minutes or more during the Week 1 opener (see CLAUDE.md), with nothing
diagnosable from outside GitHub. This script is meant to be run on a plain
Windows Task Scheduler timer every 5 minutes, always, and calls
`gh workflow run` directly instead of relying on GitHub's scheduler. It's a
no-op outside game windows, so running it unconditionally every 5 minutes is
intentional and safe — `gh` decides nothing here, this script does.

The window logic mirrors what used to live in the `schedule:` block of
.github/workflows/scoreboard.yml (kept there only as comments now, for
reference). Same caveat carries over: the season-specific Friday/Saturday
DATE_WINDOWS below have no year field and will need reviewing before the
2027 season.
