One poll: fetch this week's live matchup scores + pre-game projections for
league LEAGUE_ID, and append one timestamped snapshot to data/week<N>.jsonl.

Meant to be run every few minutes by the GitHub Actions workflow during game
windows. Safe to run any time — outside the season it just prints a message
and exits without writing anything.

def compute_projected_total(starters, players_points, projections_by_player, scoring, players_team, team_progress):
    """
    Live-projected final total for one roster: for each starter, their
    actual points so far PLUS whatever's left of their pre-game projection
    above that, decayed by how far their own NFL game has progressed — so
    the "upside" on top of actual fades out smoothly and lands on exactly
    their actual total once their game ends, instead of staying pinned at
    a ceiling or cratering the instant they score.

        elapsed = team_progress[team] if actual > 0 else 0.0
        remaining = max(pregame_projection - actual, 0) * (1 - elapsed)
        contribution = actual + remaining

    where raw `elapsed` (0.0-1.0) comes from common.team_game_progress
    (ESPN's public scoreboard for that player's team's game clock), blended
    with common.estimate_scoring_fallback_progress for any team ESPN is
    still reporting as not-yet-started despite its players already posting
    real stats — see that function's docstring. Either way, `elapsed` only
    ever applies once the player has actually recorded a point. A player sitting at 0 actual keeps their full, undecayed
    pre-game projection no matter how much wall-clock time has passed —
    "hasn't scored yet" is not evidence their opportunity is used up; it's
    just as likely their own game hasn't gotten to them yet. Without this
    gate, a quiet player's number would visibly crater over time for no
    reason connected to anything that actually happened in their game.

    FIXED 2026-09-10 (again): the first version of this decay applied
    `elapsed` to every starter unconditionally, including ones sitting at
    0 actual points. In production this showed up as EVERY roster's
    projected total sliding downward together, scorers and non-scorers
    alike, any time enough wall-clock time passed — the exact same
    complaint ("projections cratering for all teams") the kickoff-cliff
    bug produced two fixes ago, just reintroduced through a different
    mechanism (time instead of any-stat-at-all).

    FIXED 2026-09-10: replaced the previous max(actual, pregame_projection)
    approximation. That version kept a player pinned at their full
    pre-game projection for their ENTIRE game and only let the number move
    once actual overtook it — which was a real improvement over the
    original kickoff-cliff bug, but still wasn't a "live" projection, it
    was just a flatter static one. Sleeper's public API has no live,
    per-player projection feed at all (confirmed: the projections endpoint
    returns one unchanging pre-game number for the whole week — verified
    against this project's own real Week 1 data, where a roster with zero
    players who'd recorded any stat held an exactly unchanged projected
    total for over an hour of live play). This function is what actually
    makes the number live: it fakes the decay ourselves using each game's
    real clock instead of Sleeper's scoring data.

    If a player's team's game progress can't be determined (ESPN fetch
    failed, bye week, not yet posted), `team_progress.get(...)` returns
    None and we fall back to elapsed=0 — i.e. still show their full
    pre-game upside rather than silently re-creating the original
    kickoff-cliff bug by assuming their game is over.
