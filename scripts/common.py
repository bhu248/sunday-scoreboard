Shared helpers for talking to Sleeper's public API.

Everything here is a plain read-only GET — Sleeper's API needs no auth key.
Rate-limit guidance from https://docs.sleeper.com/ is "stay under 1000 calls/minute";
a single poll of one league uses ~4 calls, so we are nowhere near that.

The one endpoint Sleeper asks callers to go easy on is /players/nfl (a ~5MB
dump of every player). We cache it to disk and only re-fetch if the cache is
missing or more than 20 hours old.

    Why this exists: Sleeper's public projections endpoint
    (get_projections, above) only ever returns one static pre-game number
    per player for the whole week — confirmed both by Sleeper's own docs
    (no live-projection endpoint is documented or exists) and by this
    project's real Week 1 production data: a roster whose players hadn't
    recorded a single stat held an EXACTLY unchanged projected total for
    over an hour of live play. There is no Sleeper feed of a live,
    per-player projection to fetch.

    So poll.py builds the "live" behavior itself: each player's remaining,
    not-yet-banked projection fades out over the course of their specific
    game, using ESPN's public scoreboard purely to read the clock. See
    poll.compute_projected_total for how this fraction gets used.

    Returns {} (every team treated as "not started") on any fetch/parse
    failure, so a flaky ESPN response degrades one poll's projected totals
    back to the old full-projection behavior rather than breaking the poll

    ESPN's scoreboard has been observed to leave a game marked

    happens, team_game_progress() reports elapsed=0 for that team even
    though its players are already posting real stats in Sleeper's matchup
    data, so compute_projected_total's decay never engages and a team's
    projected total sits frozen at its pregame number all game.

    This fills that specific gap: for any team ESPN is NOT already
    reporting live progress for (frac <= 0, i.e. missing or STATUS_
    SCHEDULED), find the earliest snapshot -- in this week's full history,
    plus the in-progress poll that hasn't been saved yet -- where any of
    that team's players had a NONZERO actual (positive or negative -- a
    DEF/ST slot's `pts_allow` penalty can be negative from its very first
    scoring play, and that's just as much evidence of kickoff as a
    positive stat), and treat that moment as a proxy for kickoff:
    elapsed = (now - that moment) / FALLBACK_GAME_DURATION_SEC.

    ESPN's real clock is always trusted the moment it actually reports one
    (frac > 0) for a team -- this estimate only ever fills in for teams
    ESPN is still silently treating as not-yet-started. Because it's a
    fixed-duration guess rather than a real clock, there can be a one-time
